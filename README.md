P4 Parser State Machine Composition
 
The main ideia is to build larger P4 programs by building small P4 cextension and composing them.

P4 programs are compiled to JSON files using p4c-bm version 16, available at: https://github.com/p4lang/p4c


Command lines for composition is parsed using PLY (https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/)
